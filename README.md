# Submission Instructions
  * Work in a fork of this repository
  * Work in a branch on your fork
  * Write all of your code in a directory named `lab-` + `<your name>` **e.g.** `lab-susan`
  * Submit a pull request to this repository
  * Submit a link to your pull request on canvas
  * Submit a question, observation, and how long you spent on canvas  

# Requirements  
## Configuration  
Your lab directory must include  
* **README.md** -- with a documention about your lab
* **.eslintrc.json** -- with the class .eslintrc.json file
* **.gitignore** -- with a robust gitignore
* **.eslintignore** -- with the class .eslintignore
* **package.json** -- with all dependencies and dev-dependencies 
* **src/** -- containing the frontend code

# Feature Tasks 
Pick two of the following feature tasks:

## 1 - Implement a stable version of Quick Sort
__This is a fairly common interview question__

The Quick Sort implementation covered in class was not stable. Research and implement a stable version of the algorithm. 

## 2 - Mutate Merge Sort's input array

The Merge Sort implementation covered in class didn't mutate the input array (it creates an output array). Implement a version of Merge Sort that mutates the input array.

## 3 - Implement Radix Sort
__This is a fairly common interview question__

Research and implement [Radix Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_sort).

_This is an interesting problem since Radix Sort uses a different logic than the 'Divide and Conquer' approach covered in class_

## 4 - Implement Heap Sort

Research and implement [Heap Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort).

*The implementation can be either stable or unstable*

## 5 - Implement a Quick Sort/Insertion Sort Hybrid

Modify the Quick Sort implementation to use Insertion Sort if the length of the sorting set is less than 10 elements. 

## 6 - Implement Quick Sort with 3-way partition 

The Quick Sort implementation covered in class divided an array into two areas
*  Elements smaller than the pivot
*  Elements greater than or equal to the pivot

Research and implement a version of Quick Sort that divides the array into three areas:
* Elements smaller than the pivot
* Elements equal to the pivot
* Elements greater than the pivot

## Testing
- Write a test function that generates an array of N random integers
- Write a test function that asserts an array is sorted (based on your sorting implementation)
- Test each sort against an empty array, single-element array, small array, medium array and 10,000 item array.

## Stretch Goals
Implement the remaining feature tasks

##  Documentation  
Write a description of the project in your README.md
