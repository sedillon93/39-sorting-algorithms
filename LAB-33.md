## Feature Tasks 
### Priority Queue
From Wikipedia:


>In computer science, a priority queue is an abstract data type which is like a regular queue or stack data structure, but >where additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it. In a priority queue, an element with high priority is >served before an element with low priority. If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order >in the queue.


* Implement a priority queue ES6 class using a Binary Heap internally for data storage. Use a Min-Heap.

  * Implement a `enqueue` method with an arity of one. 
    * The enqueue method takes javascript object with a `priority` key and a `value` key and adds it to the internal min-heap.
  * Implement a `dequeue` method with an arity of zero.
    * The enqueue method returns (and removes) the value associated with the smaller priority inside the priority queue.

#### Usage example
![priority queue](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codefellows-seattle-javascript-401d19/34-priority-queue-and-2d-arrays/master/dequeue.png)
#### Stretch Goals
* Add the `peek` and `isEmpty` member functions.
  * The `peek` function returns the root of the internal heap without removing it. 

### Solve the following problem:
- You’re given a 2D array of seats and people’s heights
- People’s heights are written either like `"72 inches"` or `"5 feet 2 inches"`
- You’re given one persons seat coordinate (row, col)
- Return how many people they are blocking (they are taller than people behind them)
- Index zero represents the front of the theater
- Access seats like seats[row][col]

#### Dealing with empty seats

You may choose to assume any of the following about empty seats in the theater:

- Assume the theater is always full
- Or, assume empty seats are filled with `null`
- Or, assume empty seats are filled with `undefined`
- Or, assume empty seats are filled with the string `"empty"`

#### Sample Input
```javascript
let SEATS = [
  [ '1 feet 11 inches', '4 feet 8 inches', '2 feet 10 inches', '3 feet 5 inches', '2 inches', '3 inches', '11 inches' ],
  [ '5 feet 10 inches', '9 inches', '3 feet 5 inches', '3 inches', '9 inches', '1 feet 0 inches', '0 inches' ],
  [ '0 feet 5 inches', '5 feet 9 inches', '6 feet 1 inches', '1 inches', '1 inches', '5 feet 3 inches', '3 feet 5 inches' ],
  [ '1 inches', '0 feet 11 inches', '2 feet 5 inches', '5 feet 6 inches', '6 feet 6 inches', '6 inches', '5 feet 11 inches' ],
  [ '10 inches', '11 inches', '3 inches', '5 feet 2 inches', '9 inches', '4 inches', '1 feet 10 inches' ],
  [ '2 feet 10 inches', '11 inches', '7 inches', '2 feet 9 inches', '0 inches', '9 inches', '0 feet 2 inches' ],
  [ '3 inches', '1 inches', '5 feet 5 inches', '6 inches', '2 inches', '5 feet 7 inches', '8 inches' ]
]
